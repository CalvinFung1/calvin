<p>I am from China and graduated from moansh college. I am a person who likes sports. My favourite sport is playing basketball, so I like to stay in the basketball court on weekends. I especially like puppies, because I think puppies are natural good friends, so I am friendly with them. When I was young, something happened to me. When I was only 5 years old, my mother told me that one day I was injured by glass shards when I was playing with my puppy in the garden, then I was crying all the time, but because my mother didn't hear my crying in time, my puppy went around looking for my mother and shouting. My mother immediately found me after hearing the puppy's cry. Since then, I like puppies very much.</p>

<li>My interest in IT stems from the fact that I liked my smartphone when I was young. I think the application of the phone is very interesting. I really want to develop an application that belongs to me. When I was in middle school, I started using computers. I think the world of the Internet is very big. There are various applications on the computer, just like the chat software I am still using is called WeChat. This software impressed me, it is so powerful that we can find friends at any time, I can also share my favourite photos or videos to my friends. My parents can also contact me at any time in a foreign country. So I think IT can change my life and help me improve my quality of life, so I am very interested in IT.</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="background-color: #0000ff;">Project Ideas</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">（Overview)</span></p>
<p>The project I want to do is to develop a mobile app whose main purpose is to help users record their daily lives and share their travel experiences. This app allows every user to unleash their creativity, because this app allows users to upload not only interesting things in life, but also their own strengths. At the same time, the software is divided into different types of channels and sections, allowing users to quickly find the type channels they like. In this app, users can easily find the same friends as themselves and find friends who are different from their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">(Motivation)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to develop this software because I have a group of friends who love to travel. They often complain that it is difficult to find like-minded partners. They want people who love to travel to join their team and share the joy and interesting stories that happen during the tour. Their complaints led me to develop this mobile app. According to a report by Google called The Consumer Barometer, it clearly states that users in 46 countries around the world prefer to use mobile phones instead of computers. The penetration rate of Australian smartphones reaches 65%. It can be seen that this software can be more user-friendly and easy to spread widely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">(Description )</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to name this application: special. Because I want to create a "language" that belongs to this software. Language is the key to building the world, and the connection between people. This application just shows this "key". The best part about this application is that it puts things that users like in obvious places. If I am a user who loves the sea, when I open this app, I will see a very prominent title about the sea. It has a very beautiful cover that is the place I want to go to in my heart. The cover is very appealing to me. When I click into this channel, I will love this channel. This is what makes this application special. Why do users fall in love with this channel when they click in? This is because this app can see an expansion of the title about "the sea" in each channel. For example, users can see the experiences shared by other users sharing this topic, photos and reviews of the attraction.</p>
<p>This is just one of the features of this software, this software can also provide convenience for users, specifically this: when users share his favourite things, such as: mobile phones, computers, shoes, clothes and so on. The software can quickly provide the URL of these items according to the pattern and can be purchased online. In addition, the software will compare the prices of different shopping websites, and other users can choose to purchase. This feature will also be reflected in other aspects, assuming that A users share their travel experiences, travel plans and roadmaps in the United States, the software can help A users to create a real map and add notes. B users can quickly develop their own travel plans based on the real situation map provided by A users to understand the local situation. This app can also provide users with peripheral services, hotel reservations, purchase of attraction tickets and so on.</p>
<p>This app is not only for travel, it also provides users with a life-sharing experience, users can express their feelings on a specific channel, users can also share favourite items, places, food, restaurants and so on.</p>
<p>"Special" as a daily life application, of course, the function of chatting and finding friends. This app classifies the moods posted by users and allows strangers who share the same mood at the same time to communicate. In this information age, people will become more and more strange because of the network, but this software is to deeply understand the user's psychology and bring people closer to each other. This app will bring a new experience to users, because in the past we will only disguise ourselves and hide ourselves on the Internet. We won't reveal our true thoughts on the web, but in this application, because it has a sharing mechanism and a classification mechanism, it allows you to express your thoughts and opinions boldly in each channel. At the same time, you can also provide advice to others and help others to be happy. This is the "special" application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">(Tools and Technologies)</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>This mobile app requires java or objtective-c language for code writing. Because the mobile phone system is by far the most used by the iOS system and the Android system. The development of this software requires the use of Eclipse software, preparation before development, but also to install the Java development environment, JRE, JDK, android studio, also includes environment variable settings, simulator configuration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">(Skills Required)</span></p>
<p>To develop this application, you need to have knowledge of the Java language and XML. The software you need to use is: Eclipse and Android SDK. In developing this application, the main development will focus on interface development, certain database development, communication interface development, collaborative development and joint debugging. In addition to the development of the application, it is also necessary to take into account the user-to-application experience. Before developing the application, a detailed solution must be included, including the main direction and core functions of the software. Finally, UI design, a good UI design can be used to attract more users to download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">(Outcome)</span></p>
<p>If this application is successfully developed, it will change the traditional way of user communication, because this application is a form of sharing that makes strangers friendly. At the same time, this application may have very few people downloading and using, user data security issues. To solve this problem, application maintenance must be done. Because the application frequently appears ads, or the operation is too complicated, resulting in poor user experience. To solve these problems, continuous maintenance and update is the best way. When this software is successfully launched, it will promote the development of friendly relations between people.</p>
